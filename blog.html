                <h3>The first post :</h3>
                <p>A deadly militant attack in Pahalgam, Indian-administered Kashmir
                    , has triggered a sharp escalation between India and Pakistan, with 
                    both sides exchanging gunfire across the Line of Control and 
                    downgrading diplomatic ties. On May 6, India announced the launch
                    of "Operation Sindoor," a military strike targeting nine sites in 
                    Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Jammu and Kashmir, which it 
                    alleged were used to plan the attacks. The situation has heightened
                    fears of a broader military conflict between the two nuclear-armed
                    nations, marking the most significant bilateral confrontation 
                    since 2019.

                <p>
                    The conflict between India and Pakistan arose out of the 1947 Partition
                    of British India. The Partition established a Muslim-majority Pakistan 
                    and a Hindu-majority India and provided the diverse regions of Jammu and
                    Kashmir the opportunity to choose which country to accede to. The maharaja
                    (Kashmirâ€™s monarch) initially sought independence, as Kashmir was neglected 
                    and subjugated for centuries by conquering empires. However, he ultimately 
                    agreed to join India in exchange for help against invading Pakistani herders,
                    triggering the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947-48. The Karachi Agreement of 1949 
                    temporarily ended violence in the Jammu-Kashmir region by establishing a 
                    cease-fire line (CFL) overseen by members of a UN truce subcommittee.

                <p>
                    Throughout 2024, violence continued in Kashmir
                     in response to increasing efforts by New Delhi 
                     to consolidate territorial control. Attacks
                      specifically targeted Indian travelers and 
                      workers in the region. In June 2024, militants
                       opened fire on a bus carrying pilgrims traveling 
                       to a Hindu shrine in the town of Reasi. 
                       The attack killed nine and injured over thirty. 
                       In October, militants killed seven in Kashmir at
                        a construction site for a tunnel project connecting
                         Kashmir to the northern region of Ladakh.
